Title: IGN Code Foo submission: Quests for Link.
 
https://www.ign.com/code-foo/2020
 
 
First step for an internship admission opportunity,

and although IGN had to cancel the program in 2020,

it was fun to build a solution.
 
 
Problem:

Link of Zelda needs to collect the max Rupees possible 
by selecting the best mix of quests from a Quest Board,
and without allowing quest dates to overlap. 

This is done here by AI that models the Quest Board as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP).
 
 
Directions to run:

Depends on import of module "python-constraint" (in PyCharm, maybe the 2nd auto-import offered) or run:

        pip install python-constraint
